## Context :
- I was given 1 week to complete this solo project
## Contributors:
- Sarah Hampton - [GitHub](https://github.com/SHampton22), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-hampton-684083255/)
## Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a -    logical challenge
## Wins & Challenges:
- One win for this project was learning and implementing the setTimeout() method.
- I found it challenging to keep the DOM functions and data model methods separate.
